Data set from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/khusheekapoor/vehicle-insurance-fraud-detection
In this project, I deployed classification methods (K Nearest Neighbors, logistic regression, and decision-trees) to formulate a predictive model to detect vehicle insurance frauds. I also presented my findings in a presentation slide show.
Thanks for viewing! :)
